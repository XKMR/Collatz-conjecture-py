The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.<br/> It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
